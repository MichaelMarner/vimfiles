Michael's Vim Files
===================

This repo contains my .vimrc and the things that live in my .vim directory.

Mostly, it consists of git submodules for the plugins I use, as well as
some colour scheme stuff and local spell dictionary.

Note that there are project-specific things in the .vimrc which make it
not all that suitable for everyone to use.
